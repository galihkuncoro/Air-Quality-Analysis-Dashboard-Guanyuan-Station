## Introduction
The aim of this project is to examine data related to air quality, particularly focusing on the levels of PM2.5 pollutants, and comprehend their associations with diverse environmental elements. The analysis involves recognizing patterns over time, seasonal variations, and connections with different weather conditions.

## Data Source
The data utilized for this project comprises measurements of air quality obtained from the Wanshouxigong station. The primary emphasis is on PM2.5 levels, along with additional correlated environmental information.

## Libraries Used
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Statsmodels

## Key Insights
The primary observations include fluctuations in PM2.5 levels throughout different seasons, displaying elevated concentrations during colder months. Additionally, a correlation exists between PM2.5 levels and weather elements such as temperature and humidity. Furthermore, discernible trends and patterns are evident from the time series analysis.
